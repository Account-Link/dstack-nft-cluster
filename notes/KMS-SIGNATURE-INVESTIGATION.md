# KMS Signature Investigation

## Problem Summary
The signature verification is failing when trying to register instances with proof. The DStack simulator generates signatures that don't verify correctly against expected KMS addresses.

## Expected KMS Behavior
According to the contract design, the KMS should:
1. Sign a message with format: `keccak256("dstack-kms-issued:" + appId + appPublicKey)`
2. The signature should verify against a known KMS root address
3. This creates a chain of trust: KMS → App Key → Derived Key

## Actual Simulator Behavior
Investigation shows the DStack simulator has several mismatches:

### 1. Static vs Dynamic Signatures
- The simulator's `appkeys.json` contains a static `k256_signature`: `2f431c7956869a4fe3e028c5f9518a935e2d01e81a3628f8b1d178fc2fac7b6d2405ace433624e5568e23c4ed291dbaf60dac79b756837c0fe745154ebfdc0a601`
- This appears to be a pre-generated signature rather than dynamically signing the actual message

### 2. KMS Address Mismatch
Expected KMS addresses:
- **Contract deployment**: `0xa2eB90b26A1274fa10905da7A62ff15542f2EbFf` (from previous deployment)
- **Simulator private key**: `0xf6F3Bb63C4238E5d25c64eBAB48F44a42FC03df4` (derived from simulator's PEM key)

Actual recovered addresses from signature:
- **Format 1** (`"dstack-kms-issued:" + appId + appPublicKey`): `0xB57e7acDB7fD455Ed15C8523696840CC28e616Ec`
- **Format 2** (derived key hash): `0xb935E51Ea14F83CF9Ba52c58E8736589C6A1ec01`  
- **Format 3** (`appId + appPublicKey`): `0xc95C2a6E75E2CFB208b7e3e4b501A877492878fa`
- **Format 4** (public key only): `0xbdFed2F25B06d406f2CC8B414aDdb6F347af8F13`

**None of these match the expected KMS addresses.**

### 3. Message Format Uncertainty
Tried multiple message formats to see what the simulator might actually be signing:
- Standard format: `"dstack-kms-issued:" + appId + appPublicKey`
- Derived key hash reuse
- No prefix format: `appId + appPublicKey`  
- Public key only format

**None produced signatures that verify against expected KMS addresses.**

## Conclusion
The DStack simulator appears to use a different signature generation mechanism than what our contract expects. The static signature in `appkeys.json` suggests this may be a simplified implementation for testing rather than the production KMS behavior.

## Next Steps
1. **For testing**: Deploy contract with one of the recovered KMS addresses to test the rest of the system
2. **For production**: Investigate the actual KMS implementation or update contract to match simulator behavior
3. **Alternative**: Modify simulator to generate proper dynamic signatures

## Files Modified
- `debug_signature_verification.py`: Comprehensive signature verification testing
- Contract deployed with correct KMS root: `0x9A676e781A523b5d0C0e43731313A708CB607508`
- Enhanced error logging in `counter.py` and `signature_proof.py`

## Key Technical Details
- App signature verification works correctly (Step 1 passes)
- KMS signature verification fails (Step 2 fails) 
- All signature formats attempted, none match expected KMS addresses
- Static signature `2f431c7956...` from simulator doesn't correspond to dynamic message signing
